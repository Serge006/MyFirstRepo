Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Serge. I'm currently taking a course on Linux command-line, shell scripting, and Git version control. I'm from Rwanda and passionate about technology, building practical skills, and applying them to real projects like software development and system management.

This first repo is a stepping stone in mastering collaborative tools like Git and GitHub!
